iOS-GoodbyeWorld
================

iOS app using animation - user taps on the spinning globe animation, resulting in an explosion animation. Calculations are used to determine whether user has tapped inside the designated area or outside it (on the animated galaxy background).

Developed in February 2012 while on app development course taught by Aral Balkan.

This code was developed prior to the release of XCode 4.4 and iOS 6 but still works without errors or warnings.
